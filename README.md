# spring-ajax

**YouTube Description Example:**

In this video, you'll learn how to build a full-stack Spring Boot project with a focus on AJAX calls for consuming REST APIs, using jQuery, Bootstrap, and Thymeleaf. We’ll cover CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate and integrate secure form-based authentication with Spring Security. Additionally, we’ll work with SSL certification and JDBC connections to MySQL, ensuring secure database interactions. Follow along as we build a responsive UI, implement security features, and enhance user experience with dynamic page updates via AJAX.
